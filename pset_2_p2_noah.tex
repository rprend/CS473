Find the weight of the minimum weight dominating set of size at least $k$.

First, we define an algorithm to find the mininum weight dominating set of
size exactly $k$.

Define relations:

$$\textsc{OPT}_0(r, k) = \min 
\begin{cases} 
    A + w(r) \\
    \min_{v \in N(r)} B
\end{cases}$$
$$\textsc{OPT}_1(r, k) = C + w(r)$$
$$\textsc{OPT}_2(r, k) = \min
\begin{cases}
    D + w(r) \\
    E
\end{cases}$$

$$n = |N(r)|$$

$$A = \min_{k_1,...k_n} \left[\sum_{x = 1}^n \textsc{OPT}_2(N(r)_x, k_x) \right], \sum_{i=1}^n
k_i = k - 1$$
$$B = \min_{k_1,...k_n} \left[\textsc{OPT}_1(v,k_1) + \sum_{x = 2}^n
\textsc{OPT}_0((N(r) \setminus \{v\})_x, k_x) \right], \sum_{i=1}^n
k_i = k$$
$$C = \min_{k_1,...,k_n} \left[ \sum_{x=1}^n \textsc{OPT}_2(N(r)_x,k_x)\right], \sum_{i=1}^n
k_i = k - 1$$
$$D = \min_{k_1,...,k_n} \left[\sum_{x=1}^n \textsc{OPT}_2(N(r)_x, k_x)\right], \sum_{i=1}^n
k_i = k - 1 $$
$$E = \min_{k_1,...,k_n} \left[\sum_{x=1}^n \textsc{OPT}_0(N(r)_x, k_x)\right], \sum_{i=1}^n
k_i = k$$

Note that the values of these expressions $A$ to $E$ can be computed by the
algorithm from problem 1.

To implement this as a dynamic programming solution, we have to examine the
dependency graph. When looking at the vertex parameter, since any vertex only
depends on \textsc{OPT} values of its children, we can compute the
sets of values for the vertices in post-order, which ensures that any vertex
will have the \textsc{OPT} values of its children available when it is being
computed.

For the $k$ parameter, since for any $\textsc{OPT}_a(v,b)$ is never dependent
on $\textsc{OPT}_c(v,d)$ for any $(a,b,c,d)$, but only on values less than
$v$, the entries of a row corresponding to any vertex can be computed in any
order.

Time complexity analysis:

First, we compute a post-order traversal order for the tree, which takes
$O(n)$ time. Next, we fill out 3 $n$ by $k$ tables. For each set of 3
corresponding entries in the three \textsc{OPT} tables, we perform the
algorithm from problem 1 on the input size $n_{p1} = |N(v)|, k_{p1} = O(k)$.
For A, C, D, and E, this is done once per vertex. For B, this is done $|N(v)|$
times per vertex $v$. We repeat the entire algorithm for $k$ values of $k$ up
to $n$ to find the minimum weight dominating set of size at least k. This
yields a total runtime of $O(n^3k^3(n-k))$.
