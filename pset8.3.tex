\subsection{Problem description}

Given the region $P$ in 2D space, defined by 

$$\forall i, a_i x + b_i y \leq c_i $$,

define a linear program whose solution describes the largest axis-aligned
square that lies entirely within $P$.

\subsection{Solution}

The reduction is based on 3 variables representing the $x$ and $y$ coordinates
of a potential square, and the dimension of the square. From those 3
variables, we can compute the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each corner of the
square. Since $P$ is convex, the square is contained within $P$ iff each of
the corners is within $P$. Writing down the linear program is then
straightforward:

Maximize: 

$$x_{dim}$$

Subject to constraints:

$$\forall i, a_i x_x + b_i x_y \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + a_i x_{dim} + b_i x_y \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + b_i x_y + b_i x_{dim} \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + a_i x_{dim} + b_i x_y + b_i x_{dim} \leq c_i$$

\subsection{Problem description}

Given the region $P$ in 2D space, defined by 

$$\forall i, a_i x + b_i y \leq c_i $$,

define a linear program whose solution describes the maximum-perimeter axis-aligned
rectangle that lies entirely within $P$.

\subsection{Solution}

The reduction is nearly the same as the first part, with the exception that
now we must define the parameters of the rectangle based on 4 variables
instead of 3 because the width and height can differ, and additionally we need
to maximize the parameter, which is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the
dimensions.

Maximize: 

$$x_w + x_h$$

Subject to constraints:

$$\forall i, a_i x_x + b_i x_y \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + a_i x_w + b_i x_y \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + b_i x_y + b_i x_h \leq c_i$$
$$\forall i, a_i x_x + a_i x_w + b_i x_y + b_i x_h \leq c_i$$
